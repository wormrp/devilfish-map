## Contributions

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the map! Presently most of our map work is done by our Lore team, so your best bet is to check with them for advice on how to contribute. However, here are some basic guidelines:

1. Don't commit anything that isn't canonical to the Kaf universe.
2. If using any not-made-up (irl) data, make sure to attribute it properly. Only use data that is freely usable.
3. Do NOT submit any changes to qgs files unless you have the [Stable QGis Projects](https://github.com/opengisch/qgis_trackable_project_files) plugin installed and active.
4. Keep filesizes of any data reasonable, f.ex by only including the relevant area (for example, the main Devilfish map only needs stuff from Cook County MN and the adjacent area).

If you have any questions, please feel free to hop onto the WormRP discord and talk to us!

### What you'll need

* git or a way of gitting (obvs). If you're new to git, there's a very nice [desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/) that makes it easy.
* QGis ([here](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html), minimum version 3.14)
* Two fonts:
  * The Roadgeek 2014 series from [here](https://github.com/sammdot/roadgeek-fonts/releases)
  * Trebuchet MS (comes with windows and osx, debian use `sudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer`)

Some maps (in particular the main Devilfish map) require some files that aren't included. However, you don't need these for just adding data, so you can just ignore missing files errors. Alternatively, feel free to make them (see `data-external/ATTRIBUTION` for information)
