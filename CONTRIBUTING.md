## Contributions

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the map! Presently most of our map work is done by our Lore team, so your best bet is to check with them for advice on how to contribute. However, here are some basic guidelines:

1. Don't commit anything that isn't canonical to the Kaf universe.
2. If using any not-made-up (irl) data, make sure to attribute it properly. Only use data that is freely usable.
3. Do NOT submit any changes to qgs files unless you have the [Stable QGis Projects](https://github.com/opengisch/qgis_trackable_project_files) plugin installed and active.
4. Keep filesizes of any data reasonable, f.ex by only including the relevant area (for example, the main Devilfish map only needs stuff from Cook County MN and the adjacent area).

If you have any questions, please feel free to hop onto the WormRP discord and talk to us!
