mn-dnr-lakes.geojson is a subset of the DNR Hydrography Dataset by the Minnesota Dept. Natural Resources

https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/water-dnr-hydrography

The dataset is clipped to features within our interested area, as well as filtering out features > 500 acres in area.

usgs_alos_dem.tif is a combination of USGS 3DEP data, along with ALOS synthetic aperture radar imaging by JAXA north of the border.

The data was merged and upsampled where needed. It is not included in this repo because I ended up with a 992 MiB geotiff, but it can be easily created from the above sources:

- download the ALOS data from alaska (should be just a single file for our map coverage)
- download the USGS data, you should get four files to cover the entire region
- convert the data from UTM to EPSG:4326
- use gdalmerge to combine them. Make sure to specify the ALOS data first in the arguments so that it's overwritten by the higher-resolution USGS data south of the border. Use the argument "-n 0" to specify 0 as a nodata point as well.

If that's too much bother, grab the old data from a prior map release, and it should fit in just fine (albeit at a lower resolution, tweak as needed!)
